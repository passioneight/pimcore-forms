# When should I use this bundle?
Whenever you need to create forms. Especially, if you also need support for captchas (e.g., Google's reCAPTCHA).

# Why should I use this bundle?
Using this bundle comes with different benefits, for example:
- A clear convention on how forms are created, where the related files are stored and how they are named.
- Faster time to market, due to lowered implementation effort.
- Predefined fields that are ready to use with zero configuration.
- ... and many more.
